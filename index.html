      <h2>Where</h2>
      <h3>AT THE STRAIT OF GIBRALTAR</h3>
      <p>This is a "defined-concept" design for a bridge between Spain and Morocco, North Africa. The location is at Tafira, Spain where the shortest distance to Morocco is 7.7 miles.</p>

      <h2>Why Not a Bridge or a Tunnel?</h2>
      <p>Extensive soil and rock surroundings were done in 2005. It was clearly determined that no suitable foundations for a structural overhead bridge are available. This condition is the result of two major tectonic plates which separate Africa from Europe. Movement between these plates will continue. Obviously, a bored tunnel such as the "Chunnel" is not possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>A submerged bridge allows for unlimited marine traffic in a busy strait that serves over 20 countries in the Mediterranean. Note that the draft of supertankers is 94 ft. and for large cruise ships is 28 ft.</p>

      <h2>The Construction</h2>
      <p>High density, high strength, precast- concrete sections are constructed on land and assembled aat sea, joined by special water-tight gaskets. The length of the sections depend on the local skills available. Since no suitable foundations are available, precast concrete anchors are placed below and connected to the submerged bridge, keeping the submerged bridge depressed 100-120 ft. below the surface of the sea. Cables, such as KEVLAR are used to connect the submerged bridge to the foundations (These 1.5 inch cables will support 50 tons of stress and are very resistant to salt waters).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Yes, It Wants to Float</h2>
      <p>Precast sections will weigh 13 tons per lin. ft, and the water displaced by the structure weighs 23 tons per lin. ft. This difference (10 tons per lin. ft.) will be supported, in tension, by the cables connected to the concrete foundations. Thus, the 2 traveling trains' weight will not allow the submerged bridge to depress unless the 10 tons per lin. ft. is exceeded. Only cable-stretch is affected.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Its Purpose?</h2>
      <p>Two separated electric trains are shown, which can carry passengers, autos, freight, and mail. Two Libyan oil pipelines are mounted on the wall of train room as well as fireoptic and telephone cables. Between them is a "safe room" to provide emergency shelter if needed. Marine doors separate this space. Separate electrical sources for each train allow extra safety. Below the "safe room" is an area called "sump" which collects any water seepage. A compressed-air line powered from shore purges the sump area of any water seepage. The area above the "safe room" provides space for transformers, electrical lines, and equipment.</p>
    
      <h3>Electrical Power</h3>
      <p>Mounted atop the bridge structure are multiple electrical power generators, utilizing the constant 3.5 mph current flowing from the Atlantic Ocean into the Mediterranean. Huge amounts of pollution-free energy would benefit both continents.</p>
      <p>Engineers estimate 10 units, 12 ft. diam. 3 bladed, produce 57 kw/hr. Or 500 megawatts/yr.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Who Benefits?</h2>
      <p>Those experts trained in commerce can best explain the mammoth benefits of trade and tourism business made possible by uniting these great continents. Few countries in Europe or Africa will fail to benefit. In 2012, the Chunnel moved 18.2 million passengers and hauled 20 million tons of freight. Success of this design could lead to duplication in the future. Cost estimate is $5-6 billion, plus terminals.</p>
      <p>Servicing the debt and operating cost are fees, fares, freight, pipeline leasing, electricity generated, and subsidies for clean energy.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Now?</h2>
      <p>The first English channel tunnel was proposed in 1802, but the technology to accomplish the feat had to wait a century and a half, and for peaceful relations with the two nations.</p>
      <p>In this case the technology is available <em>NOW</em>. May the nations to benefit seize the opportunity. History has been altered over much less.</p>

      <h2>Prior Designs</h2>
      <p>A study by OAPC, completed in 1996, produced a bridge design by T.Y. Lin. His design produced a remarkable, stayed-suspension bridge with a 5000 meter main span at a cost of $15 billion. However, information from seabed boring in 2005 and current knowledge of the tectonic plates movements, as well as costs, leads to disfavor.</p>
      <p>In 2004 Eugene Trui, architect, proposed an elaborate, submerged bridge design with a 3 mile floating island in the center of the strait. It included 24 lanes of vehicle traffice, 2 trains, etc. at an estimated cost of $40 billion. No details are available to me. Serious ventilation questions from vehicle traffic, the huge floating island which limits marine traffic, and the enormous cos, leads to disfavor.</p>
